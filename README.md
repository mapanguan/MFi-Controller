# MFi Controller
iOS Project showing how to read MFi controller input.

The demo assumes the use of a single controller with extended profile (i.e. two shoulder buttons and two triggers). 
I'm working on adding support for tvOS.

Currently the demo can
* detect a controller connection / disconnection
* read values from all inputs and display them numerically
* move a cute crab around the screen
